                Handling of a Car

                    The handling of a car is how a vehicle reacts when being driven. 
                    A car with really good handling can be easily driven, while the other side, extremely bad handling would make the car harder to control. 
                    The factors that contribute to the handling of a car are mainly the tires and the suspension.

                    The tires of a car are the main thing that receives the output from the motor. 
                    Usually, the tire is connected to a rim, which is then bolted onto the studs of the wheel bearing. 
                    They are usually made out of a mixture of natural and synthetic rubber which help it take the abuse than fully natural rubber.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reason why synthetic rubber is mostly used in a tire is because of the abuse it can take, that being friction and wear from the ground. 
                    As a tire on a car is used, friction from the ground causes heat, which slowly deforms and melts the rubber. 
                    And if the tire is being used on the road, the tarmac or asphalt acts like sandpaper, slowly wearing the treads of a tire down. 
                    They also give an excellent amount of grip for the car. 
                    This is ideal for a car because sliding in a car with no grip makes the car almost impossible to drive. 
                    However, tires on everyday road cars usually don’t have 100% synthetic tires because they suffer from tearing and cracking, which is why tires are a mix of natural rubbers and synthetic rubbers.

                    The torque, or the twisting force from the engine is not directly applied to the wheels in a car. 
                    Instead, the torque goes to the flywheel. 
                    It is then transferred to the clutch plate where it connects with the splines of the transmission. 
                    From the transmission, it then goes to the driveshaft or the axles, depending on the layout of the car.<br> 
                </p>    
                <p>
                    The reason why it depends on the layout of the car is because different cars can have different layouts- All Wheel Drive (AWD), Front-Wheel Drive (FWD), Rear-Wheel Drive (RWD), or Four-Wheel Drive (4WD).
                    All Wheel Drive, a layout that is becoming increasingly common, is when all the wheels of the car are receiving the power output from the engine. 
                    From the transmission, the torque is split with a 50:50 ratio between the front and the rear.

                    It is usually on SUVs, some sedans, and hypercars and is best for utilizing grip which contributes to the handling of the car. 
                    Front-wheel Drive is where the front-wheels of a car are receiving the power output from the engine letting it  “pull” the car forward. 
                    It is best utilized for grip in the front of the car. 
                    This is the only configuration where a drive shaft isn’t necessary. Rear-Wheel Drive is where the rear wheels of the car receive the power output from the engine. 
                    The rear wheels are “pushing,” Four-Wheel Drive is a mix of front-wheel and rear-wheel drive, where the power is split between all four wheels, notably from the front and rear with a transfer case. 
                    The ratio of the torque from the transfer case can be adjusted, either by the car’s computer or manually.
