                Cars are an influential part of life today. 
                They get millions of people from A and “flood” busy cities every day. 
                However, what keeps cars on the road and how do they work? 
                To understand how a car works, people have to understand <i>“what is considered a car?”</i> 
                According to Wikipedia, <i>”A car is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation” meaning that it must have:
                <ul>

                        </span>
                        <span class="list-summary">
                            In modern days, this motor is usually an internal combustion engine. 
                            However, electric motors are a cleaner alternative, they are becoming less rare.<br>

                            Wheels aren’t just for making the car be able to move. 
                            They contribute to the grip of the car, which takes in wear and heat from friction and the abuse from the power output of the motor. 
                            Besides that, there are different ways the power from the motor goes to the wheels.<br>
