                    In a simplified view, there are 2 main parts of an engine. There is the block, which has the pistons, the crankshaft, the connecting rods from the piston to the crankshaft, and a gear or wheel. Then there is the “head,” which has the camshaft, the valves (at least 2 per cylinder), a spark plug, a gear or wheel and a fuel injector, depending on the type of engine. From the head and the block, there is a chain or rubber belt that connects the head’s camshaft to the crankshaft.

                    In today’s cars, there are four main cycles that an engine needs to perform: intake air and fuel, compress the two together, combust the mixture, and then blow the exhaust out.<span class="exception">*[2]</span>

                            In order for the other cycles to occur, the engine needs air and fuel for it to combust. 
                            The piston in the cylinder goes down and the valves open, making the cylinder a vacuum for air. 
                        </span>

                            After intaking air, the piston goes back towards the head, mixing the air and the fuel together.

                            The mixture of air and fuel is then ignited by a spark from the spark plug. 
                            This makes a force on the piston, pushing it towards the crankshaft which ultimately makes the piston go “down.”

                            After combustion, the piston then goes back up, and the exhaust valve opens, which pushes out the remains of the mixture, which is the exhaust.

                        From the engine, the power goes from a fly-wheel, to a clutch, and then the transmission. 
                        From the transmission, it depends on the layout of the car’s drivetrain.<br> <br>

                        Due to the lack of knowledge, we do not have a perfect explanation for this article.

                        As previously mentioned, the electric motors in today’s cars are becoming increasingly more common, due to the low emissions they produce. This is because internal combustion engines emit carbon dioxide particles as a byproduct of the combustion of the fuel and air. The most common types have DC motors<br><br>
