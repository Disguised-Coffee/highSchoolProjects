(8.2.9 - Finalizing Tic Tac Toe)

Desc:
The Tic Tac Toe program is one of the highlighted creations in the CodeHS AP CS A section. Here is my version of it.
However, as of right now, the game itself may not work.

Assignment Desc:
Your game should take user input to determine which index the user would like to place their X’s and O’s, and check to see if there is a winner after every turn that is taken. If the user inputs an invalid space, they should be notified, and asked to input another index. Utilize loops to implement this effectively!
Your game should indicate which player won, and notify the users if there is a tie at the end.
