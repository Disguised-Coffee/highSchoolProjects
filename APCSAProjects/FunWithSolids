(9.6.9 - Fun With Solids)

Desc:
One of the most very tedious but easy(ish) assignments in the Inheritance unit of my AP CS A course. 
The program will calculate the volume and surface area of different 3d shapes.

Assignement Desc:
Given the Solid class, extend it with:
  Pyramid
  Cylinder
  RectangularPrism
  Sphere
  
Make sure to create the constructor and override the volume and surfaceArea methods.

Also extend RectangularPrism with Cube.
