(9.6.7 - Cars)

Desc:
This program will take the car model, its type of fuel, and the fuel level of the vehicle. It will use the inputted information to create a car object and store it in a Car array in order to output a list of cars along with their information.

Assignment Desc:
In this exercise, we are going to revist our Car and ElectricCar class from lesson 3. In lesson 3, you were given the Car class and needed to complete the ElectricCar class. You can use your code from that exercise to get started here.

The focus of this exercise is the CarTester class. In this class, create an ArrayList that can hold Cars and ElectricCars. Then, you will prompt the user for a car model. Ask for either the remaining battery percentage or the amount of fuel left, depending on whether the car is electric. Add each car to the ArrayList.

You will continue asking the user until they exit, then you will loop through your ArrayList and print the results.
