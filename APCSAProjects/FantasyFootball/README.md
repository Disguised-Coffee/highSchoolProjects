Assignment Desc:
Create a program that allows you to create a fantasy football roster based on the existing list of available players.

Your team can only have 5 players, so create an array that can store 5 possible players.

Prompt the user to pick 5 players to add to their team. If the player is available in the list of availablePlayers, then add that player to the userâ€™s array, and remove that player from the availablePlayers list. Then prompt the user to pick another player. Once all five players have been added, print the list in the console.

Create a search method to find the index at which the player is located in the availablePlayers list so you can make sure that they are an eligible pick and remove the player from the available pool of players.
